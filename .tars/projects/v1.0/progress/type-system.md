# Type System Enhancement Progress

## Overview

Track the progress of implementing enhanced type safety and validation in the Composaic plugin system.

## Current Status: Planning Phase

üü° In Progress

## Milestones

### 1. Initial Type System Audit

‚¨úÔ∏è Not Started

- [ ] Review current type definitions

- [ ] Identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Catalog existing plugin type usage

### 2. Enhanced Type Definitions

‚¨úÔ∏è Not Started

- [ ] Design new plugin metadata types
- [ ] Create extension point type system
- [ ] Implement plugin interface contracts
- [ ] Add runtime type validation

### 3. Migration Strategy

‚¨úÔ∏è Not Started

- [ ] Document breaking changes
- [ ] Create migration guides
- [ ] Build automated migration tools
- [ ] Test with example plugins

### 4. Testing & Validation

‚¨úÔ∏è Not Started

- [ ] Unit test coverage
