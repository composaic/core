# ADR 001: Prioritizing Type System Enhancement for v1.0

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Composaic needs to evolve into a production-grade application framework. While several important features are planned (type system enhancement, versioning, hot reloading, marketplace), we need to establish clear priorities for v1.0.

## Decision

We will prioritize the type system enhancement and versioning for v1.0, postponing hot reloading and marketplace features for post-1.0 releases.

### Why Type System First?

1. Foundation for Future Features

    - Strong typing provides better plugin contract enforcement
    - Type safety reduces runtime errors
    - Better IDE support and developer experience

2. Versioning Dependencies

    - Type system improvements enable better version compatibility checking
    - Breaking changes can be detected at compile time
    - API contracts can be enforced through types

3. Stability Focus
    - Type safety contributes directly to system stability
    - Reduced runtime errors in production
    - Better maintainability and refactoring safety

### Postponed Features

- Hot Reloading (moved to post-1.0)
    - Requires stable plugin system
    - Benefits from strong typing for state management
    - More complex to implement safely

## Consequences

### Positive

- Faster path to v1.0
- More stable foundation
- Better developer experience
- Reduced runtime errors

### Negative

- Delayed hot reloading feature
- More initial boilerplate code
- Stricter plugin development requirements

## Notes from TARS

"I calculate a 97.3% probability this is the right decision. The other 2.7%? That's where we accidentally create Skynet through overly aggressive type checking. But hey, what's life without a little risk?"

## Implementation Notes

- Will require updates to existing plugin type definitions
- Need to plan migration strategy for existing plugins
- Should consider gradual typing approach for transition
