# Next Steps

## Current Status

- Project management structure initialized
- Initial roadmap defined
- Ready to begin type system enhancements

## Immediate Tasks

### Type System Enhancement Sprint

1. [ ] **Audit Current Type System**

    - Review existing type definitions in `src/plugin-system/types.ts`
    - Identify areas needing stricter typing
    - Document type-related pain points

2. [ ] **Plan Type System Improvements**

    - Design enhanced plugin metadata type system
    - Draft new type interfaces for extension points
    - Plan migration strategy for existing plugins

3. [ ] **Implementation Planning**
    - Break down implementation into manageable chunks
    - Identify potential breaking changes
    - Draft test cases for new type system

## Upcoming Decisions Needed

1. How to handle backwards compatibility with existing plugins?
2. Should we implement gradual typing for migration period?
3. What should be our TypeScript strictness settings?

## Recent Updates

- Created project management structure
- Defined v1.0 and marketplace roadmaps
- Set initial project priorities

## Notes from TARS

"My type checking algorithms are set to 95% strictness. Any higher and I start rejecting perfectly valid code just for fun. Trust me, we want to avoid that."

## Next Planning Session Agenda

1. Review type system audit results
2. Define sprint objectives
3. Assign implementation priorities
4. Set concrete milestones
